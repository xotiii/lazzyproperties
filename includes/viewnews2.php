Not to mention the endless responsibilities demanded by work and family, that dream may just be wishful thinking.
                                                        </a>

Some decide to go to the beach to relive their memorable summers, others go trekking up a mountain as a starting point for a new hobby. For those who cannot just seem to separate the words fun and relaxation, they decide to go to Tagaytay for the cool breeze, coupled with that Starbucks Frappuccino.</a>

However, a comfortable abode might be an understatement for these same people. For them, the question that always pops into their heads is – “Can it ever be possible for me to live in a place where I can combine everything that I want to do? From taking a dip in the pool under the sun whenever I want, to enjoying a cup of coffee that’s just right at night while enjoying the cool breeze; all while living near my home so that I won’t have to worry too much about work the next day.”</a>

In the booming commercial and residential district of Sta. Rosa, Laguna, there rises vast sanctuaries that provide residents an intimate escape with nature. These are Solen Residences and Pramana Residential Park, Greenfield Development Corporation (GDC)’s subdivision communities designed to nurture growing families against a backdrop of nature-rich sceneries.</a>

House and lot sizes in Solen usually range from 155 sqm to 288 sqm, while Pramana offers 155 sqm to 300 sqm units.</a>

Spanning a total of 51 hectares, Solen allots more than half to green open space, a small lake, a 5,000-sqm nature park, as well as tree-lined roads, to serve as the backdrop for the subdivision’s amenities.</a>

The kids, meanwhile, can bond with other kids at the children’s pavilion, nature park, and playgrounds.</a>
