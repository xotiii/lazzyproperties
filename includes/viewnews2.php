A Chinese group lobbed a winning record bid for a residential plot, while Guocoland Ltd. paid a record per-square foot price for an office development site in the central business district. Office rents last quarter rose for the first time in 2 1/2 years and home prices ended a four-year slide.

The spending spree may not be over, with more than S$3.3 billion ($2.5 billion) of land deals set to be completed by the end of the year, pushing the annual total to S$14 billion, the highest since 2011, according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.

“Singapore’s residential and office market has passed its inflection point, embarking on an exciting recovery journey,” said Christine Li, a director of research at Cushman. “With brighter economic prospects and improved market sentiment in the next two to three years, developers are increasingly sourcing land sites to ride the wave of growth for the rest of the decade.”</a>

Home prices could rise as much as 10 percent next year, according to analysts from Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas SA and UOB Kay Hian Pte.<br>

With housing-affordability much better in Singapore, there may be a surge in demand next year, according to BNP Paribas.</a>
